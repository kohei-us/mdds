    method.

mdds 2.0.1

* general

  * addressed various coverity issues.

    not copied when the parent container was copied.  In soa, the
    element_block_acquired() callback was not called for the cloned element
    blocks.

  * added move constructors and move assignment operators to both aos and soa
    variants.

mdds 2.0.0

    adjustment implementations to determine the optimal loop-unrolling factor.

* rectangle_set

  * permanently removed.

* rtree

  * fixed a bug where the memory positions of invalidated child nodes were not

mdds 1.5.0

* documentation

  * moved the documentation hosting to readthedocs.io, and adjusted the build
    steps.

  * added the overview section for flat_segment_tree.

* multi_type_vector

  * fixed the static get(const const_position_type& pos) method for the

    issue with std::vector<bool> not having the at() method.

  * fixed an issue with the const position() method not returning a valid end
    position the same way the non-const variant does.

  * added steps to traverse blocks backward from the postiion specified in the
    position hint.  This may result in improved performance in some
    situations.

    * (u)int8_t

    * (u)int16_t

    * (u)int32_t

    * (u)int64_t

  * The numeric_element_block has been renamed to double_element_block.

    vectors.

  * added new page for R-tree.

* flat_segment_tree

  * fixed invalid memory access issue related to the swap() method which
    previously did not swap the non-leaf node pool store.  The invalid
    memory access may occur after the contents of two instances get
    swapped, one instance get destroyed then the caller calls
    search_tree() on the other instance still alive.

* flat_segment_tree

  * fixed a bug that would cause segmentation faults with the insert()
    method with out-of-bound segment value pair.

mdds 1.2.1

  * search_result has been renamed to search_results.

mdds 1.1.0

* all

  * switched our build system to using automake.

* packed_trie_map (new)

    fails to find valid block position, to make it easier to debug.

mdds 0.10.3

* multi_type_vector

  * added 2 variants of release_range() that take start and end positions,
    to allow releasing of elements in specified interval.  One of the
    variants takes iterator as a block position hint.

    * iterator push_back_empty()

mdds 0.10.2

* multi_type_vector

  * fixed a bug in transfer() that would trigger an assertion and
    eventually lead to a crash.  The problem occurred when a range of
    data to be transferred spanned over 2 blocks and consisted of the
    lower part of an upper block and the upper part of a lower block.

mdds 0.10.1

    search_tree(), by optimizing the non-leaf node object generation
    and storage to achieve better locality of reference.

* segment_tree

  * slight performance improvement on build_tree(), as a result of the
    optimization done for flat_segment_tree since these two structures
    share the same tree generation code.

    * template<typename _T> iterator
      release(const iterator& pos_hint, size_type pos, _T& value)

    releases all elements and makes the container empty afterward.

  * added a new variant of position() that takes const_iterator as
    position hint.

    * set(size_type pos, const _T& it_begin, const _T& it_end).

  * added compile-time macro MDDS_MULTI_TYPE_VECTOR_USE_DEQUE to allow
    users to specify std::deque as the underlying data array.  By
    default, multi_type_vector uses std::vector as the underlying data
    array container.

  * added a new variant of swap() that allows partial swapping of
    content with another container.

  * added static block type identifier so that the numeric block type
    ID can be deduced from the block type directly.

  * value_type (which is a type of object returned when dereferencing
    an iterator) now stores 'position' which is the logical position
    of the first element of a block.

  * added position_type and const_position_type which are typedefs to
    the return types of position() methods.

* multi_type_matrix:

  * get_numeric(), get_boolean(), and get_string() are made more
    efficient.

    takes const_iterator.

mdds 0.8.0

* all

  * added .pc file for pkg-config.

* flat_segment_tree

  * changed the return type of search_tree from bool to
    std::pair<const_iterator,bool>, to make it consistent with the
    search() method.  Note that this is an API-incompatible change.

* multi_type_vector

  * added char and unsigned char types to the standard types supported
    by default.

  * added position() member method that takes a logical element
    position and returns a pair of block iterator where the element
    resides and its offset within that block.

  * added at() static member method to the data block, which calls the
    at() method of the underlying std::vector container.

  * added release() member method to allow caller to release an object
    stored inside a managed block.

  * added two templates to ease creation of custom element block
    functions when using one or two custom element types.

  * added transfer() member method to allow elements in a specified
    range to be transferred from one container to another.  When
    transferring elements stored in a managed element block, the
    ownership of those elements is also transferred.

mdds 0.7.1

* multi_type_vector

  * fixed a bug in set_empty() where emptying a whole or partial block
    would fail to merge its adjacent block(s) even when they are also
    empty.

mdds 0.7.0

* multi_type_vector

  * add variants of set() methods (both single- and multi-value)
    insert(), set_empty() and insert_empty() methods that take an
    iterator as an additional position hint parameter for block lookup
    speed optimization.

  * add support for non-const iterators which allow the client code to
    modify values directly from the iterators.

  * set() methods (both single- and multi-parameter variants),
    set_empty(), insert() and insert_empty() methods now return
    iterator that references the block to which the values are set or
    inserted.

  * fixed bugs in set() method (single-parameter variant) which would
    insert a new block at incorrect position.

  * fixed bugs in set() method (multi-parameter variant) which would
    fail to merge neighboring blocks of identical type under certain
    conditions.
