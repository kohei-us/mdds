* all

  * added .pc file for pkg-config.

* multi_type_vector

  * added char and unsigned char types to the standard types supported
    by default.

  * added position() member method that takes a logical element
    position and returns a pair of block iterator where the element
    resides and its offset within that block.

  * added at() static member method to the data block, which calls the
    at() method of the underlying std::vector container.

  * added release() member method to allow caller to release an object
    stored inside a managed block.

  * added two templates to ease creation of custom element block
    functions when using one or two custom element types.

mdds 0.7.1

* multi_type_vector

  * fixed a bug in set_empty() where emptying a whole or partial block
    would fail to merge its adjacent block(s) even when they are also
    empty.

mdds 0.7.0

* multi_type_vector

  * add variants of set() methods (both single- and multi-value)
    insert(), set_empty() and insert_empty() methods that take an
    iterator as an additional position hint parameter for block lookup
    speed optimization.

  * add support for non-const iterators which allow the client code to
    modify values directly from the iterators.

  * set() methods (both single- and multi-parameter variants),
    set_empty(), insert() and insert_empty() methods now return
    iterator that references the block to which the values are set or
    inserted.

  * fixed bugs in set() method (single-parameter variant) which would
    insert a new block at incorrect position.

  * fixed bugs in set() method (multi-parameter variant) which would
    fail to merge neighboring blocks of identical type under certain
    conditions.

mdds 0.6.1

* all

  * use property files in the Visual Studio project files, to share
    some of the common custom build variables across all projects.

  * various build fixes and compiler warning eliminations.

  * fixed link error with boost 1.50.

  * fixed make installer script which previously would not install
    mdds/compat headers.

* flat_segment_tree

  * fixed a bug in its iterator implementation, which previously would
    always treat the last valid position before the end position as
    the end position.  This fix affects both in const_iterator and
    const_reverse_iterator.

mdds 0.6.0

* all

  * added MSVS Solution file, to make it easier to build unit test
    programs on Windows.

* mixed_type_matrix

  * improved performance of size() method by caching it.

* multi_type_vector (new)

  * new data structure to support efficient storage of data of different
    types.

* multi_type_matrix (new)

  * new data structure to eventually replace mixed_type_matrix.  It uses
    multi_type_vector as its backend storage.

mdds 0.5.4

* segment_tree

  * fixed build breakage, to allow it to be buildable when UNIT_TEST
    is not defined.

  * fixed a crasher with MSVC when comparing iterators of empty
    search_result instances.

* point_quad_tree

  * fixed a bug where de-referencing copied search_result iterators
    would return an uninitialized node data.

mdds 0.5.3

* mixed_type_matrix

  * re-implemented the filled storage for better performance, with two
    separate implementations for zero and emtpy matrix types.  The
    newer implementation should improve object creation time
    considerably.

mdds 0.5.2

* flat_segment_tree

  * fixed a crash on assignment by properly implementing assignment
    operator().

  * fixed several bugs in shift_right():

    * shifting of all existing nodes was not handled properly.

    * leaf nodes were not properly linked under certain conditions.

    * shifting with skip node option was not properly skipping the
      node at insertion position when the insertion position was at
      the leftmost node.

  * implemented min_key(), max_key(), default_value(), clear() and
    swap().

  * fixed a bug in operator==() where two different containers were
    incorrectly evaluated to be equal.

  * added quickcheck test code.

mdds 0.5.1

  * fixed build issues on Windows, using MSVC compilers.

mdds 0.5.0

  * flat_segment_tree's search methods now return a std::pair of
    const_iterator and bool, instead of just returning bool.

  * fixed a weird enum value mis-handling with mixed_type_matrix when
    compiled with MSVC++.

  * added new insert() method to flat_segment_tree that takes a
    positional hint in order to speed up insertion speed.  Also, all
    three insert() methods now return the start position of the
    segment that an inserted segment belongs to.

  * slight performance improvement on the insert methods of
    flat_segment_tree.

  * slight performance improvement on the iterators of
    flat_segment_tree.

  * re-organized the structure of flat_segment_tree to split it into
    multiple headers.

  * properly support prefix, docdir, includedir configure options.

  * support DESTDIR environment variable for make install.

mdds 0.4.0

  * implemented mixed_type_matrix.

mdds 0.3.1

  * added support for boost::unordered_map (boost) and std::hash_map
    (stlport) in addition to C++0x's std::unordered_map.

mdds 0.3.0

  * implemented point_quad_tree.

mdds 0.2.1

  * added example files on how to use these data structures.

  * fixed a bug in segment_tree::search_result object, to make it work
    with empty result set.

  * fixed segment_tree to make it really usable outside of unit test
    code.

mdds 0.2.0

  * other general performance improvements.

  * lots of code cleanups.

  * support for search result iterator in segment_tree and
    rectangle_set, for better search performance.

  * implemented rectnagle_set.

  * fixed lots of bugs in the segment_tree implementation.

mdds 0.1.2

  * implemented segment_tree.

  * node_base class is now without virtual methods to avoid vtable
    generation.
